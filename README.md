# LazyTools
A suite of scripts I wrote for my daily uses.

- playlist-duration.py -> I use this script when I want to approach a playlist of videos on YouTube to learn more about a topic and I want to know how long it will take me to watch it. Since YouTube does not provide this feature

- converter.py -> It is used to download mp3 files from a YouTube video playlist without using YouTube API keys but only by parsing from the pages.
