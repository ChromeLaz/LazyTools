# LazyTools
A suite of scripts I wrote for my daily uses.

#How to use the script
   ~ I recommend you to use scripts to create a virtual environment so as not to install packages on the python system.
    
    // Create a virtual enviroment in the current folder
    python3 -m venv youtube_env

    // Activate the virtual enviroment
    source youtube_env/bin/activate

    // Install the main library 
    pip install yt-dlp

    // Execute the script 
    python3 xxx.py




- playlist-duration.py -> I use this script when I want to approach a playlist of videos on YouTube to learn more about a topic and I want to know how long it will take me to watch it. Since YouTube does not provide this feature

- converter.py -> It is used to download mp3 files from a YouTube video playlist without using YouTube API keys but only by parsing from the pages.
